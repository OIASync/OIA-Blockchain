# OIA-Blockchain

OIA Blockchain

Overview

The OIA blockchain project is a dual-chain blockchain system that integrates both UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) and EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchains under a unified mechanism. This setup allows for seamless transaction handling and validation across both blockchain types using a single OIA token transaction.

Features

Dual-Chain Integration: Manages UTXO and EVM chains with a single mechanism.
OIA Token: Facilitates token transfers, staking, and rewards.
Flexible Transactions: Perform UTXO and EVM transactions in one go.
Proof-of-Work Mining: Supports mining for both UTXO and EVM blocks.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Web3 Library: For interacting with Ethereum nodes.
Environment Variables: Set up for Ethereum and Bitcoin API keys.
